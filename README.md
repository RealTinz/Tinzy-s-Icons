idk if this works on pc but on mobile follow these instructions: 
make a folder in "mods" folder then put the polymod stuff. then add a folder in the folder that u made inside of mods called "images".
inside of images, make a folder called "icons". then put all the pngs. 

if ur on pc im not sure if this will work but follow these instructions: 
grab all the pngs, then navigate assets. then, navigate images. then, go to icons, then drop the pngs. 
youll likely get the question to replace some files. choose yes.
