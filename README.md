idk if this works on pc but on mobile follow these instructions: unzip the file, then put it in the "mods"
folder. then make a folder in this mod titled "images". then make a folder in images titled "icons".
then put all of the pngs except for the png "_polymod_icon" in the icons folder.

if ur on pc im not sure if this will work but follow these instructions: 
grab all the pngs, then navigate assets. then, navigate images. then, go to icons, then drop the pngs. 
youll likely get the question to replace some files. choose yes.
